# MATHS_FOR_ML

Welcome to Weekend Learner | My Data Science Journal

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a digital notebook and learning space for my mathematical explorations. Here, you'll find notes, summaries, examples, and potentially code implementations related to different areas of mathematics that I am currently studying or find interesting.

**My goals for this repository are to:**

* **Consolidate my understanding:** By writing down and organizing concepts, I aim to deepen my own grasp of mathematical principles.
* **Share my learning journey:** While primarily for personal use, I hope that the content here might be helpful to others who are also learning or reviewing these topics.
* **Practice clear and concise mathematical communication:** Presenting mathematical ideas in an understandable format is a valuable skill.
* **Potentially explore computational aspects:** In some cases, I might include code (e.g., in Python) to illustrate mathematical concepts or solve problems.

## Topics Covered (Subject to Growth)

As this is an ongoing project, the topics covered will expand over time. Currently, you might find content related to:

* **[Week-1 | Matrices]**
* **[Week-2 | Linear Algebra]**
* **[Week-3 | Vector Spaces]**
* **[Week-4 | Matrices Decomposition]**
* **[Week-5 | Vector Calculus]**
* **[Week-6 | Continous Optimization]**
* **[Week-7 | Non-Linear Optimization]**
* **[Week-8 | Dimensionality Reduction & PCA]**


**Note:** The level of detail and the specific sub-topics covered within each area will vary. This repository reflects my personal learning path and interests.
